  <p>We've heard it, we've read it, memorized parts of it, and we've even watched it in films. The Sermon on the Mount. The one sermon that goes down in history as thee greatest sermon ever preached by the King himself, Jesus Christ.

Well, if this is indeed true, if this is the greatest sermon ever preached, I want to know it. I want to devour it. I want to live in these three chapters in order that I may apply, live, and practice what our Lord taught that day.

Join me as we meet Jesus up on the mountain. Sit with me and the other disciples and let us learn from our Rabbi. We will walk through this study slowly. Taking our time. Drinking deeply. Enjoying the journey. Growing in knowledge and holiness.

<h1 class="header">THE SERMON AS A WHOLE</h1>
  <p class="content">I have learned that it is a wise rule in the study of any teaching to proceed from the general to the particular. This is the only way of avoiding the danger of 'missing the wood because of the trees'. I think many of us tend to fix our attention on particular statements, and to concentrate on them at the expense of others. Some look forward to a particular Beatitude while others enjoy jumping straight to The Lord's Prayer. Here's how we fix that: Realize that no part of Jesus' Sermon can be understood except in the light of the whole. Unless you and I have understood and grasped this Sermon as a whole, we cannot gain true understanding of any particular verse.

  <h1 class="header">JESUS ADDRESSES THE CHRISTIANS</h1>

  <p>
    When we look at The Sermon, the gospels and the epistles in terms of morality and conduct, the appeals are always based on the assumption that the people to whom these matters are addressed are Christian. Thus, we cannot expect, nor can we ask anyone who is not a Christian to live out the Sermon on the Mount. It is utterly impossible if one is not born again to obey the teachings of Jesus.

  In addition, it is pointless to confront someone with a particular injunction in the Sermon on the Mount unless this person has already believed, and accepted, and has indeed already conformed to, and is living, the Beatitudes- which are the marks of a new nature. The Beatitudes do not come at the end. They come at the beginning. Everything else follows the Beatitudes with which our Lord's sermon starts. There is supreme importance in which the statements come in the Sermon. Certain postulates are laid down, and on the basis of those, other things follow. </p>
